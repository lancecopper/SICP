; This code would never end because the initial 
; values i = j = k = low. The solution is k = âˆš2 
; low which is not an integer. This will cause 
; the require to fail, an-integer-starting-from 
; will then backtrack to the next possible value of k, 
; which of course will also fail and since there is 
; no limit on k the procedure will never complete. 
; Even if we set low to 3 and start j from i+1 the first 
; solution of (3,4,5) will be found, but on calling 
; try-again for another solution, the same situation occurs.
